abolish_segregation_desc;The institution of segregation -- a division of races into a first and second class citizenry -- had existed in various forms in $COUNTRY$ since the abolishment of slavery. However a new vision of equality and unity begins to take root. With courage and conviction, we stand at the crossroads of our past and future, ready to dismantle the chains of segregation that have long divided our people.
